Making the world more easily understandable...

Starting with one atom and one photon at a time...

Using guerilla fighting skills, applied to many-body non-equilibrium systems,
helped with distributed tools, and with disregard of excessive labels...
   

With passion to improve knowledge accessibiliy and (re)use...

This is a directory of my realized projects undertaken with the above stated
goals and approach.
They include both research, educational, open-source and community based projects.
If you are **scientists or educator** check `Knowledge infrastructure`_, if you 
are **doing AMO physics research** check `Research`_, and if **you are learning**
check `Teaching`_. Hopefully something would be useful, something can be reused
in your work, something maybe intrquing, and you might even want to contribute
and improve. You can also get in touch at
**nikola  sibalic  delete_spaces_put_@  physics.org**
