Teaching
========

I have been involved in teaching, course/competition creation, marking,
and supervision at all levels of physics eduction (primary school -> highschool 
-> undergraduate -> postgraduate).

Selected materials
------------------

* Free, interactive `introductory eBook to Rydberg physics`_ for advanced undergraduate and new postgraduates, covers introduction to highly excited Rydberg states in atoms and solid state, and their applications in quantum optics, metrlogy and quantum simulation.

* Physics world `blogpost`_ and `article`_ about using interactive materials to enhance learning and improve discussion of ideas is available here.

Additionally, check projects that can
be used to support both teaching and suppport on `Knowledge infrastructure page`_ :

* `Roundtable`_ online table and whiteboard for meetings with collaborative feedback, supporting file sharing, collaborative annotations, equations, etc.

* `Caroline`_ - framework for creation of HTML based presentations, with optional features that allow interaction with audience through quizzes and collaborative whiteboard sharing.

Round table meetings 
--------------------

I have been organizing meeetings of early stage researchers (PhDs and postdocs),
connecting different groups in  department, using **a new format of meetings** to 
focus on efficient communication
of transferable ideas. For more details on methodology of
the meetings check the `infographics`_.

Experimental hardware design
----------------------------

Video introduction accessible to lay public, on importance of scientific instruments,
introducing a web platform `ResearchX3D`_ for sharing scientific apparatus models,
stories and design tips.
