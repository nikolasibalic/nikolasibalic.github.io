    **ARC (Alkali.ne Rydberg Calculator)**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ARC (Alkali.ne Rydberg Calculator) is package of routines written in Python,
    using object-oriented programming (OOP) to make modular, reusable and extendable
    collection of **routines and data** for performing useful calculations of single
    atom and two-atom properties, like level diagrams, interactions and
    transition strengths for alkali and divalent atoms. Gradually extended to
    be all-encompasing Python toolbox for atomic-physics calculations.

    **Atom calculator**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Web applications providing not only simple interface to ARC, but also generic
    scheduling of complex longer calculations, notificatoins when calculations
    are done, retrival of similar calculations, and interactive plots.
    This lowers boundary to use of scientific knowledge, by
    **bringing state-of-the-art AMO knowledge from labs to pubs.**

    **ResearchX3D**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    All science is **experimental** by definition, yet designing new experimental
    apparatus is usually not being explored with much detail in education. This
    is hard 3-dimensional problem, that requires interdisciplinary knowledge.
    ResearchX3D collects 3D models and makes also photogrametic reconstructions
    based on submited photographs of scientific apparatus from around the world.
    Models can be anotated with 3D pointers to "show-and-tell", sound, equations,
    figures... and everything is available on 28 langauges. sorted by knowledge
    level (from primary school to research level).

    **Roundtable**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In real life meetings around Roundtable everyone can point and add their
    sketched idea on the presented material. Now we extend that experience for
    meetings with physical distancing, with many participants, or even with
    participants distributed around the world. Have engaging meetings with
    collaborative feedback using this distributed discussion surface!
    This is **made for scientific discusisons**, supports sharing and collective
    exploratoin and annotation of pdf, images, source-code, Jupyter notebooks,
    with free hand or with typed annotations (LaTeX included). You can download
    annotated samples and shared files. Everything is stored just among peers.

    **Caroline**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Caroline is open-source Python framework for interactive web/HTML+JS based
    science presentations. With Caroline you can **show and annotate everything**.
    Interface is minimalistic and focus is on content. Caroline blurs distinction
    between slides and whiteboard, between demonstration and derivation, and
    smoothly even crosses from one way lecturing to interacting with the audience
    **allowing real-time note-taking, quizzes and even all-to-all collaboration**.
    Caroline is made specifically not just to impress the audience but to allow
    you to do everything you possibly can to reach "aha!" moment of understanding
    and inspiration,

    **Interactive Publishing**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    This project provides quick starting point for anyone who wants to experiment
    with interactive text and figures in their electronic publications 
    (EPUB3 / HTML5 + JavaScript). One possible reason why one would use
    **interactive text and figures** is to communicate many possible stories to the
    audience, instead of usual single story line. See Physics World blogpost.
