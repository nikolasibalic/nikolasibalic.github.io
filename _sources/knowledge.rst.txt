Knowledge infrastructure
========================

**Why?** Many of the important `challenges we face as humanity`_  rely on coordinated work of many experts and organizations. To be able to mobilize society-wide response to raise up to the scale of the challenge, we need to enable knowledge to be not only more easily accessible, but also more easily reused by domain non-experts. We also need more transparency into origins of expert insights, to enable progression when expert opinions differ, and to enable feedback from non-experts that might crucially expand our solution-space horizons. Existing solutions of knowledge dissemination and reuse are not fit for the scale of interdisciplinarity and coordination we have to achieve: we need a new knowledge infrastructure.

.. sidebar:: Quote

   "E.B. White, one of our last great idealists, was eternally right when he asserted half a century ago that the role of the writer is “to lift people up, not lower them down” — a role each of us is called to with increasing urgency, whatever cog we may be in the machinery of society. Supply creates its own demand. Only by consistently supplying it can we hope to increase the demand for the substantive over the superficial — in our individual lives and in the collective dream called culture."
   — `Maria Popova`_

**What?** If we make good interfaces for finding and reusing knowledge, we can enable society-wide collaboration. Many people pointed in the similar direction over the history, from `Vannevar Bush in "As we may think"`_ (The Atlantic, July 1945),
over `Douglas C. Engelbart in "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"`_ (October 1962)
to `Bret Victor in "The Humane Representation of Thought"`_ (2014). What is maybe now more evident than ever is that knowledge accessibility is only the first step toward knowledge reuse and application in everyday life. A new knowledge interface has to enable better and easier learning, reuse and communication across the domain and societal boundaries.

**How?** By combining information technology at its best with physicists' approach of progressive problem solving, it might be possible to provide necessary tools. The Internet is the perfect way to deliver these tools world-wide, and open-source is the only way to actively engage with a diverse community. Specific realized projects, which continue to be maintained and enlarged, are presented below.

    **ARC (Alkali.ne Rydberg Calculator)**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ARC (Alkali.ne Rydberg Calculator) is package of routines written in Python,
    using object-oriented programming (OOP) to make modular, reusable and extendable
    collection of **routines and data** for performing useful calculations of single
    atom and two-atom properties, like level diagrams, interactions and
    transition strengths for alkali and divalent atoms. Gradually extended to
    be all-encompasing Python toolbox for atomic-physics calculations.

    **Atom calculator**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Web applications providing not only simple interface to ARC, but also generic
    scheduling of complex longer calculations, notificatoins when calculations
    are done, retrival of similar calculations, and interactive plots.
    This lowers boundary to use of scientific knowledge, by
    **bringing state-of-the-art AMO knowledge from labs to pubs.**

    **ResearchX3D**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    All science is **experimental** by definition, yet designing new experimental
    apparatus is usually not being explored with much detail in education. This
    is hard 3-dimensional problem, that requires interdisciplinary knowledge.
    ResearchX3D collects 3D models and makes also photogrametic reconstructions
    based on submited photographs of scientific apparatus from around the world.
    Models can be anotated with 3D pointers to "show-and-tell", sound, equations,
    figures... and everything is available on 28 langauges. sorted by knowledge
    level (from primary school to research level).

    **Roundtable**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In real life meetings around Roundtable everyone can point and add their
    sketched idea on the presented material. Now we extend that experience for
    meetings with physical distancing, with many participants, or even with
    participants distributed around the world. Have engaging meetings with
    collaborative feedback using this distributed discussion surface!
    This is **made for scientific discusisons**, supports sharing and collective
    exploratoin and annotation of pdf, images, source-code, Jupyter notebooks,
    with free hand or with typed annotations (LaTeX included). You can download
    annotated samples and shared files. Everything is stored just among peers.

    **Caroline**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Caroline is open-source Python framework for interactive web/HTML+JS based
    science presentations. With Caroline you can **show and annotate everything**.
    Interface is minimalistic and focus is on content. Caroline blurs distinction
    between slides and whiteboard, between demonstration and derivation, and
    smoothly even crosses from one way lecturing to interacting with the audience
    **allowing real-time note-taking, quizzes and even all-to-all collaboration**.
    Caroline is made specifically not just to impress the audience but to allow
    you to do everything you possibly can to reach "aha!" moment of understanding
    and inspiration,

    **Interactive Publishing**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    This project provides quick starting point for anyone who wants to experiment
    with interactive text and figures in their electronic publications 
    (EPUB3 / HTML5 + JavaScript). One possible reason why one would use
    **interactive text and figures** is to communicate many possible stories to the
    audience, instead of usual single story line. See Physics World blogpost.

    **Carteevent**
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Simple web service that **mines cultural events** in Paris and around and **geolocalizes**
    them on the map. Events are sorted categorized, and events with
    category **tags can be searched using logical AND and OR operators**. This enables powerful features:
    instead of searching for individual "dancing", "exposition"
    tags, you can easily see a map of "swing dancing or photo exposition" events
    for example. It allows saving the list of selected events and map views
    in your **local browser memory** too, giving strong privacy protection.
